So, this is my first big project inspired by Jesse Metzger (https://github.com/jmetzg11).
He gave me two weeks to build good looking web app as a challenge to prove that I am not a lazy bum.
Later on, at 2 am I  was thinking about what gist of my application would be already for a while, when an idea of creating app
where 4 useful things that user can do would be stacked at one place came to my mind.
My knowledge of html css and js is preety bad atm so it is good practice for me.
My app will contain in itself 5 parts:
1. Home page
2. Todo app
3. Text editor
4. A survey application where you will be able to ask me quiestion which is going to be send to DB(Firebase)
5. Password generator

Hope, you enjoy my project
